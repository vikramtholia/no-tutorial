        <p >Welcome to NoTutorial!</p>
        <p >When we think of starting something new, the initial steps are the most difficult. Same applies to switching to new technology. Whether you are looking for new job or new opportunities in same company, there is always new stuff to learn The technology has always been this way, it keep changing faster than we can learn.</p>
        <p >It is always this same process. You go out there, figure out which technology is popular enough to get you new opportunities, learn all about it and prepare for interview.</p>
        <p>There are some difficult parts in this process.</p>
        <p>First it is always difficult to be on track, not to get distracted and be motivated enough to carry on. Second, to find good and reliable resources to learn. Third, to be able to ask for help whenever you need it. And at last, learning theory is not enough. You got to have the opportunity to apply what you have learnt.</p>
        <p>This NoTutorial community is an attempt to solve above problems. We have live and recorded sessions for you. Once you join a course, you are given actual tasks which help you learn and apply your knowledge. We have daily Google Hangout meetings to discuss your tasks and keep you on track. We share great learning resource as well. </p>
